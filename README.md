# NX_Savonius-Darrieus-VAWT
Designed and optimised a Savonius–Darrieus hybrid wind turbine CAD model based on published research papers. Developed parametric components in Siemens NX, focusing on blade geometry, assembly accuracy, and manufacturability.

# 📌 Overview

This repository contains a parametric 3D CAD model of a Savonius–Darrieus hybrid wind turbine developed in Siemens NX. The design is inspired by aerodynamic research and focuses on hybrid rotor efficiency, blade interaction, and manufacturable engineering structure.

The project combines drag-based Savonius blades and lift-based Darrieus blades into a unified rotor assembly suitable for engineering analysis and future simulation work.
